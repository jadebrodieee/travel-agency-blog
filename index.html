<h3>Diving into the Unknown: Adventures Beneath the Surface</h3>
<p>Join me as I share tales from beneath the waves, where Iâ€™m less of a fish out of water and more of a human trying not to float up too fast.</p>

<p>There are many UK inland dive sites, however here is a list of sites I would recommend</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stoney Cove</li>
    <li>Capernwray Diving centre</li>
    <li>Wraysbury Dive Centre</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my reasons for only suggesting these 3</p>

<ol>
<li>All three have multiple wrecks</li>
<li>The sites are filled with a variety of fish and wildlife</li>
<li>They offer swimming so you can take the whole family</li>
<li>Capernwray has sturgeons</li>
</ol>
